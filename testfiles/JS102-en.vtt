00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:06.979
So, what it the best method for learning JavaScript?

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:13.790
When you are a complete beginner, I will recommend to look at examples, tweak them,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.460
change small things, try to understand how the syntax looks like.

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.130
Even without deep explanations, without reading a book, or studying in details

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.609
the different concepts of language, you can learn a lot.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.010
So, in this section, I propose that you look at a small example

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.590
without understanding the details, and try to tweak it.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.300
So here is the example we provide.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.160
It's just an example that draws, that plots, a mathematical function.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.840
So you can use the mouse wheel to zoom in, zoom out, and you can look at the HTML code.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.239
There is only very few CSS and very few lines of JavaScript.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.859
So how can we do the such a complex result?

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:14.531
Complex thing drawing the grid with axes, with labels, with a curve,

00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:18.531
and interact with the mouse.

00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:26.800
With only 10 lines of code: it's because we are using what we call an external JavaScript library.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.289
Actually, we are using 2 of them here.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:37.201
Because, this one: the "function-plot" JavaScript library, is using internally another one

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:40.159
you must include also in the document.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:45.580
So, what I propose is that we will start looking at this example.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.280
The best way is to click on "Edit on CodePen" label here,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:02:03.060
it will open the code in the CodePen.io online editor. And... just look at the HTML part here.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.969
Okay, we can just look at the HTML part and zoom in a little bit.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.900
What do we see?

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:16.730
We can see that it uses 2 libraries here between &lt;script&gt; and &lt;/script&gt; elements.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:23.600
This is how we can insert in the document an external JavaScript file.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.560
In that case, it's a remote JavaScript file because we are downloading it using http.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.590
So it uses this "d3js" JavaScript library that is located at "d3js.org".

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:48.200
You can open this in another tab and you will see the documentation and the Web site,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.560
the homepage of the Web site, for the "d3js" library.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:03.330
By the way "d3js"is one of the most popular JavaScript library for visualizing data.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:11.600
So let's go back to our example, so you can just tweak the different elements.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.160
If I want to plot a cosinus instead of a sinus, I don’t need to understand the whole

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.310
syntax here, but I guess that by just typing "cos" here, it will do something.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.610
And indeed I have just drawn a cosinus.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.900
If I change this for "green", it changes the color.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.690
If I change the grid, that is by default "true", if I say "false", I don't have a grid anymore.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:50.820
Okay let's put it back. And I've got some "xAxis" domain : "-1, +1".

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:57.860
If I change that for "-10, +10", I can see the result.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:06.780
So it's more interesting, if you change this for the x values... instead of going from PI to 2 PI.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.120
I went from 0 to 10 PI.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.840
So I can see the result here, and so on...

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.789
So now that you tweak the example, you can try to understand what is going on.

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:25.699
Okay, this thing is a name followed by a parenthesis.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:31.530
an open parenthesis with a closing parenthesis.

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.879
It's a function call.

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:40.440
When you've got something like that, in JavaScript, function parenthesis with something in the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.150
middle, it's called a "function call".

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.479
We're going to call a function, that, in this case,

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:52.770
we haven’t written, so it's coming from one on the external libraries.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.219
In that case, it's the "function-plot" library.

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.520
What is inside? There are the parameters.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.759
And I can use an external name.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:10.289
I can declare that, here, it's equivalent.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.160
You see that it works the same here, but I’ve just separated the two things.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:24.610
If I put directly this thing inside here, like it was before, it still works.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.180
Okay, so what is this syntax?

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:34.020
In JavaScript, when you’ve got braces like that, opening braces and closing braces,

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.740
it’s called an object.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.819
And inside an object, you've got properties and values.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:46.189
The properties have names: target, data, function, color, grid.

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.129
And the values are after a column characters.

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:51.770
The target is my function.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.319
The data is this thing.

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:57.439
The grid is true, and so on...

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:03.580
So you separate the different properties of the object using a comma

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:10.360
and sometimes, you can have some properties that in turn, have a value that is an object.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.280
So the xAxis property is equal to an object that has a property domain,

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:22.550
that has for values: "-1, 1".

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:30.870
And when you've got brackets, opening and closing brackets, it's like that...

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.270
That will define arrays of things in JavaScript.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:38.389
And an array of things is a list of enumerable elements.

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:46.199
So in that case, the domain has two elements: the minimum value and the maximum value.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.129
And here you can see that the data that are plotted, the cosinus function,

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:54.919
is also an array.

00:06:54.919 --> 00:07:00.419
So, if I use the comma and I introduce a second element here.

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:12.499
For example, the sinus function, and if I change the color, let's make it pink... Look at the result:

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:18.529
I've got 2 different functions that have been plotted in my graph.

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:30.590
So I can, instead of using this, I can maybe plot x2 (x square 2), like this, okay.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:35.030
It should work. Ok, we can see a little bit of it here.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:42.559
So maybe we will change the domain, so instead of stopping at 1, we go to 10.

00:07:42.559 --> 00:07:44.599
Here we go!

00:07:44.599 --> 00:07:51.150
And if we look at the values, we see the x square function that is a bit better,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:08:03.490
and if we just plot it for x=0 to x=2...

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:10.360
...In that case, i've got another scale for looking at the functions.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.710
So, in this first example, you saw how to use an external library,

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:23.830
what is the syntax to call a function, and how we can define objects in JavaScript

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:30.449
by using a set of properties and values, separated by a comma.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:42.570
And we also had a first encounter with what we call arrays, that are elements separated by commas inside brackets.
